Color classification is an important application that is used in many areas. For example, systems that perform daily. SVM classifier with an optimal hyperplane life analysis can benefit from this classification process. For the classification process, lots of classification algorithms can be used. Among them, the most popular machine learning algorithms are neural networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, Bayes network, support vector machines. In this work for training, SVMs are used and a classifier model was tried to be obtained. SVMs algorithm is one of the supervised learning methods. SVM calls for solutions to regression and classification problems as in all supervised learning methods. This algorithm is usually used to training for separate and classify different labeled samples. As a result of training with SVM, it is aimed to create an optimum hyperplane and classify the data in different
classes. This hyperplane is located as far away from the data as possible to avoid error conditions.

**Dataset**

The datasets have contained about 80 images for trainset datasets for whole color classes and 90 images for the test set. colors which are prepared for this application is y yellow, black, white, green, red, orange, blue a and violet. In this implementation, basic colors are preferred for classification. and created a dataset containing images of these basic colors. The dataset also includes masks for all images. we create these masks by binarizing the image. we did the masking on the images I collected and painted the pixels belonging to the class color to white and remaining pixels to the black color.",FALSE,"['earth and nature', 'computer science', 'classification', 'deep learning', 'image data']",ODbL-1.0

Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry.

This is one of the famous cartoon shows, that we would have never missed watching during our childhood. Now, its time to use our deep learning skills to detect our favorite characters - **Tom** and **Jerry** in the images extracted from some of the shows.

# Data Preparation

This dataset contains more than 5k images (exactly 5478 images) extracted from some of Tom & Jerry's show videos, that are available online.
The downloaded videos are converted into images with 1 frame per second **(1 FPS)**

### Labeling for these images is done manually (by going through images one by one to tag them as 1 of the 4 outcomes), so the accuracy of ground_truth is 100%

Labeled images are separated into 4 different folders as given.

**Folder - tom_and_jerry**
      **SubFolder tom - contains images only with 'tom'**
      **SubFolder jerry - contains images only with 'jerry'**
      **SubFolder tom_jerry_1 - contains images with both 'tom' and 'jerry'**
      **SubFolder tom_jerry_0 - contains images without both the characters**

### ground_truth.csv file contains labeled data against each image file

# Inspiration

1. Detect the presence of characters 'tom' and 'jerry' in any given image
2. Find the total screen time of Tom only, Jerry only, with both Tom & Jerry, without Tom & Jerry (Note: each image is extracted with 1FPS, which can help us to estimate the total screening time in seconds of Tom & Jerry after we detect these characters in these images)
3. Estimate maximum screen time showing both Tom & Jerry in the show (continuously) (Note: The image name is created based on the order of appearance, say file name - **frame500.jpg** indicates the frame extracted at 500th second of the video

# Challenges in the data

There are images that can be challenged during training in image classification, as these images are distorted in the original size or shape and color of the characters. These image details are given in **csv file - challenges.csv** Doing error analysis on these images after model training, will help us understand how to improve the score.

Few examples are given below:

This data set was created to determine if a CNN could be trained to classify female facial images into one of two classes, Beautiful or Average.  I have always had a preoccupation with faces. In particular I was curious as to how we seem to have a built in pattern recognition system in our brains that differentiates people by their facial morphology. This differentiation can take many forms but one of the most common is our seemingly subconscious classification of beauty. So I decided if a CNN could be trained to make a similar classification. Towards this end I gathered 2000 images of fashion models from all over the world to use as the images for the Beautiful data set. I then gathered 2000 images selected from the CELEB data set. From that data set I selected women that appeared to be in about the same age range as the fashion models but that I thought were of ""average"" appearance. Of course this is MY interpretation of average which will differ from what others might consider as average. Thus there is a natural bias in the selection. I used a similar process to select the images for the Validation set and the test set. I also included in the data set a Consolidated data set which combines the training, test and validation images into a single data set. This is useful for those that wish to create their own training, test and validation splits.

### Content

The data set consists of a training set, a test set, a validation set and a consolidated set. Each of these sets contains two folders labeled as Beautiful and Average. For the training set there are 2000 images in the Beautiful folder and 2000 images in the Average folder. For the test set there are 150 images in the beautiful folder and 150 images in the Average folder. The validation set is similarly divided into 150 images of each type. The consolidated folder 2300 images in the Beautiful folder and 2300 images in the Average folder. The consolidated folder combines the images from the training, test and validation sets into a single set. This is convenient for users that want to create their own splits of training, test and validation images.
All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color jpg images. Images have been cropped to only show the face. All data sets were run through a duplicate image detector and all duplicate images were removed to prevent leakage between the data sets.


### Acknowledgements

Images for the ""Average"" female images were selected from the CELEB data set.


### Inspiration

The CNN I used demonstrates very high accuracy on the classification of the test set. I am concerned however that since I selected what I considered to be ""Average"" female faces that the results are heavily biased my MY opinion. I would be curious to see what the results would be if the user selects faces to feed into the trained model for classification and see if they agree with the classification. I have posted a Predictor kernel that uses the trained model to make predictions. Unfortunately I can not run this kernel on the existing data set due to its structure on kaggle. However users can download that kernel and use it with images they select for classification. To us this kernel download the data set and use the files beauty.txt and beauty-224-224-100.0.h5 with the Predictor kernel For best results crop your candidate image to just include the face and convert it to a 224 X 224 X3 image. ******WARNING ****** to male users!!!!

I do a lot of work with image data sets. Often it is necessary to partition the images into male and female data sets. Doing this by hand can be a long and tedious task particularly on large data sets. So I decided to create a classifier that could do the task for me.


### Content

I used the CELEBA aligned data set to provide the images. I went through and separated the images visually into 1747 female and 1747 male training images.
I also created  100 male and 100 female test image and 100 male, 100 female validation images. I want to only  the face to be in the image so I developed an image cropping function using MTCNN to crop all the images. That function is included as one of the notebooks should anyone have a need for a good face cropping function. I also created an image duplicate detector to try to eliminate any of the training images from appearing in the test or validation images. 
I have developed a general purpose image classification function that works very well for most image classification tasks. It contains the option to select 1 of 7 models for use. For this application I used the MobileNet model because it is less computationally expensive and gives excellent results. On the test set accuracy is near 100%.


### Acknowledgements

The CELEBA aligned data set was used. This data set is very large and of good quality. To crop the images to only include the face I developed a face cropping function using MTCNN. MTCNN is a very accurate program and is reasonably fast, however it is notflawless so after cropping the iages  you shouldalways visually inspect the results.

Since we are working on an image classification problem I have made use of two of the biggest sources of image data, i.e, ImageNet, and Google OpenImages. I implemented two python scripts that we＊re able to download the images easily. A total of 3058 images were downloaded, which was  divided into train and test. I performed an 80-20 split with the train folder having 2448 images and the test folder has 610. Both the classes Rugby and Soccer have 1224 images each.

Our data structure is as follows:-

The past years have witnessed great progress on remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and its wide applications. With RS images becoming more accessible than ever before, there is an increasing demand for the automatic interpretation of these images. In this context, the benchmark datasets serve as essential prerequisites for developing and testing intelligent interpretation algorithms. After reviewing existing benchmark datasets in the research community of RS image interpretation, this article discusses the problem of how to efficiently prepare a suitable benchmark dataset for RS image interpretation. Specifically, we first analyze the current challenges of developing intelligent algorithms for RS image interpretation with bibliometric investigations. We then present the general guidance on creating benchmark datasets in efficient manners. Following the presented guidance, we also provide an example on building RS image dataset, i.e., Million-AID, a new large-scale benchmark dataset containing a million instances for RS image scene classification. Several challenges and perspectives in RS image annotation are finally discussed to facilitate the research in benchmark dataset construction. We do hope this paper will provide the RS community an overall perspective on constructing large-scale and practical image datasets for further research, especially data-driven ones.

Annotated Datasets for RS Image Interpretation
The interpretation of RS images has been playing an increasingly important role in a large diversity of applications, and thus, has attracted remarkable research attentions. Consequently, various datasets have been built to advance the development of interpretation algorithms for RS images. Covering literature published over the past decade, we perform a systematic review of the existing RS image datasets concerning the current mainstream of RS image interpretation tasks, including scene classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and change detection.

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. Your skull, which encloses your brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside your skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening.

# The importance of the subject
Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patients life therefore 

# Methods
The application of deep learning approaches in context to improve health diagnosis is providing impactful solutions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), proper brain tumor diagnosis involves detection, brain tumor location identification, and classification of the tumor on the basis of malignancy, grade, and type. This experimental work in the diagnosis of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) involves detecting the tumor, classifying the tumor in terms of grade, type, and identification of tumor location. This method has experimented in terms of utilizing one model for classifying brain MRI on different classification tasks rather than an individual model for each classification task. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based multi-task classification is equipped for the classification and detection of tumors. The identification of brain tumor location is also done using a CNN-based model by segmenting the brain tumor.

# About Dataset
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets : 
[figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427)
[SARTAJ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
[Br35H](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection?select=no)

This dataset contains **7022** images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: **glioma** - **meningioma** - **no tumor** and **pituitary**. 

no tumor class images were taken from the Br35H dataset.

I think SARTAJ dataset has a problem that the glioma class images are not categorized correctly, I realized this from the results of other people's work as well as the different models I trained, which is why I deleted the images in this folder and used the images on the figshare site instead.

## Note
Pay attention that The size of the images in this dataset is different. You can resize the image to the desired size after pre-processing and removing the extra margins.

Abstract
Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. A second dataset with 106 features including 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features obtained from these images was used. Models were created by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms for the feature dataset and by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset, and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99.87% for ANN, 99.95% for DNN and 100% for CNN. With the results, it is seen that the models used in the study in the classification of rice varieties can be applied successfully in this field.",FALSE,"['agriculture', 'computer science', 'computer vision', 'cnn', 'image data']",CC0-1.0

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).  There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). 

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children＊s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients＊ routine clinical care. 

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

This dataset is of casting manufacturing product.
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.
Reason for collect this data is casting defects!! 
Casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process.
There are many types of defect in casting like blow holes, pinholes, burr, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc.
Defects are an unwanted thing in casting industry. For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company.

We decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this, we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem.

### contain 

These all photos are top view of submersible pump impeller(google search for better understanding).
The dataset contains total 7348 image data. These all are the size of (300*300) pixels grey-scaled images. In all images, augmentation already applied.

Also uploaded images size of 512x512 grayscale. This data set is without Augmentation. This contains 519 ok_front and 781 def_front impeller images. 

For capturing these images requires stable lighting, for this we made a special arrangement.

there are mainly two categories:-
1) Defective 
2)Ok

making classification model we already split data for training and testing into two folders.
Both train and test folder contains def_front and ok_front subfolders.

# Abstract
A  Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases,  among children and adults.  Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central  Nervous  System(CNS)  tumors.   Every year,  around  11,700  people are diagnosed with a brain tumor.  The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women.  Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A  manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.

Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification.  Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

### Context

Brain  Tumors are complex.   There are a  lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s).  This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor.   Also,  a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis.  Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI＊.  So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.


### Definition

To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

There are several ""Hymenoptera"" datasets on Kaggle, all of them (to this date) with a usability score under 4.0. This is an effort to improve upon them, and include code examples to demonstrate how the data can be used for a binary Image Classification exercise.

### Content

Here you will find images for two species in the order Hymenoptera, specifically ants and bees. The images can be used for a binary classification exercise. I've made a notebook (available in the code tab of the dataset) meant to be run either locally or on Kaggle. The code uses the Kaggle CLI for downloading the images to their corresponding location, and implements a ResNet-based CNN for demonstrating Image Classification.

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It kills more children younger than 5 years old each year than any other infectious disease, such as HIV infection, malaria, or tuberculosis. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays may help confirm the diagnosis.

### Content
This dataset contains 5,856 validated Chest X-Ray images. The images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. Images are labeled as (*disease*:NORMAL/BACTERIA/VIRUS)-(*randomized patient I*D)-(*image number of a patient*). For details of the data collection and description, see the referenced paper below.

According to the paper, the images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children＊s Medical Center, Guangzhou.

A previous version (v2) of this dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. Note that the files names are irregular in v2, but they are fixed in the new version (v3).

Having seen multiple datasets related to face mask detection on Kaggle, one dataset which stood out contained 3 classes (with mask, without a mask, and wearing mask incorrectly), unfortunately, the dataset was highly imbalanced and uncleaned. So to improve this dataset, images had to be augmented in such a way that each class has an equal distribution of images and removing noisy images which could be considered as outliers. Thus this dataset that I've created is a combination of an existing dataset that has been cleaned and equally distributed across each class.


### Content

The dataset contains 3 folders labeled as to which class they belong to. the 3 classes are ""with_mask"", ""withou_mask"", and ""mask_weared_incorrect"". Each folder holds 2994 images of people that belong to such a labeled class.
